                                        Our $TROUT contract is designed following the nature of SafeMoon, which was done to create a strong token that has potential beyond the scope of Bear Game, Bear DAO, and the ecosystem. This token has a 25% sale tax applied to it that contributes directly to the liquidity pool.<br></br> This sale tax was a community suggestion, was voted on by the community, and has been a proven way of increasing stability with the token.

                                        To stabilize $TROUT, the goal of the team is to add meaningful utility to $TROUT instead of aimlessly adding funds to the liquidity pool. This promotes the longevity of the token, increasing community involvement, and leads to further growth within the DAO and ecosystem. More details follow below.
